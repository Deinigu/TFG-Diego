## Description üìã
This project aims to develop a system composed of a neural network capable of detecting and classifying the different chess pieces arranged on a chessboard, as well as their positions on the board itself. Using digital image processing techniques, the system identifies the position of each piece and provides this information in FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation), which allows to easily reproduce the layout of the board.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Piece Detection:** The system can identify different chess pieces (pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens and kings) and their color (white or black). 
- **Piece Classification:** Accurate classification of the detected pieces according to their type and color. 
- **Board Recognition:** Detection and mapping of the chessboard grid. 
- **Output in FEN Notation:** Generation of a string in FEN notation that represents the exact arrangement of the pieces on the board, thus facilitating their analysis and reproduction.
## Starting üöÄ
### Requirements üìã

Before starting the installation, make sure that your system meets the following requirements: 

- **Operating System**: Windows, Linux, macOS. 
- Python 3.8 or higher 
- `pip` (Python package manager) 
- Git` (optional, to clone the repository) 
### Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
#### Clone the Repository (Optional) üìÇ

If you want to clone the application repository from GitHub, run the following command: 
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Deinigu/TFG-Diego.git
```
#### Create a Virtual Environment üõ†Ô∏è

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other dependencies. Use the following commands:

- To create the environment:

```bash
python -m venv environment-name
 ```

- To activate it on Linux/macOS:

```bash
source environment-name/bin/activate
```

- To activate on Windows:

```bash
.environment-name/bin/scripts/activate
```
#### Install dependencies üì¶

Install the necessary dependencies for the application using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

To verify that the installation process was successful, run the following command on the repository path:

```bash
python main.py -h
```

Executing this command should return a list of the different console parameters that can be used for the application. If not, something has gone wrong during installation and you should check it.
